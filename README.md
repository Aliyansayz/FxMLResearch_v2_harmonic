Addition Of Harmonic Mean Of the Low (the Candle difference of previous day low price and present day low price) and also Harmonic Mean Difference Of High (the Candle difference of present day high price and previous day high price)

      # in this way:- 
      harmonic mean low : 
      difference = prev_low - current low  # rolling over last 45 days 
      hm_low  = last_45_days_diff --> mean harmonic value 
      
      
      harmonic mean high:
      difference= current high - prev_high # rolling over last 45 days
      hm_high  = last_45_days_diff --> mean harmonic value 
      


Such that when there is an uptrend :-
*  📊 present day low becomes higher and more higher usually
*  📊 present day high becomes higher and more higher usually

*  ✔️ harmonic mean low experiences a little drop due to negative values inclusion due to prev_low - current_low but `prev_low < current low` as previous low value was greater than current low value .
*  
*  ✔️ harmonic mean high experiences a rise due to positive values inclusion due to current high - prev_high as `current high > prev_high ` as current high value was greater than previous high value . 



Such that when there is an downtrend :-
*  📊 present day low becomes lower and more lower usually
*  📊 present day high becomes lower and more lower usually

*  ✔️ harmonic mean low experiences a little rise due to positive values inclusion due to prev_low - current_low but `prev_low > current low` as previous low value was smaller than current low value .
*  
*  ✔️ harmonic mean high experiences a little drop due to negative values inclusion due to current high - prev_high as `current high < prev_high ` as current high value was smaller than previous high value . 


Addition Of Relative Strength Index Crossover

Addition Of Hour 4 Supertrend and it's crossover With large factor to only diverge when large price swing is confirmed that can be pivotal in predicting next day candle or next 6 to 18 candles of hour 4.
